# Using Vault-K8s

## Install Vault-K8s using Helm charts

First, before we install Vault, make sure injector support is enabled in the Vault Helm Chart values.yaml file.
```
injector:
  enabled: true
```

Clone the Git repo for Vault Helm
```
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm
```

Next, let’s configure a demo namespace, set the current context to it, and install Vault using the Helm Chart.
```
kubectl create namespace demo
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=demo

helm install --name=vault \
       --set='server.dev.enabled=true' \
       ./vault-helm

```

Next, connect to Vault and configure a policy named “app” for the demo. This is a very non-restrictive policy, and in a production setting, you would typically want to lock this down more, but it serves as an example while you play around with this feature.
```
kubectl exec -ti vault-0 /bin/sh

cat <<EOF > /home/vault/app-policy.hcl
path "secret*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF

vault policy write app /home/vault/app-policy.hcl
```

Next, we want to configure the Vault Kubernetes Auth method and attach our newly recreated policy to our applications service account (we’ll create the application in just a minute).

```
vault auth enable kubernetes

vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
   token_reviewer_jwt="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" \
   kubernetes_host=https://${KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR}:443 \
   kubernetes_ca_cert=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt

vault write auth/kubernetes/role/myapp \
   bound_service_account_names=app \
   bound_service_account_namespaces=demo \
   policies=app \
   ttl=1h
```

Finally, let's create an example username and password in Vault using the KV Secrets Engine. The end goal here, is for this username and password to be injecting into our target pod's filesystem, which knows nothing about Vault.
```
vault kv put secret/helloworld username=foobaruser password=foobarbazpass
```

Here is an example app.yaml configuration file for running a demo application. This spawns a simple web service container useful for our testing purposes. We are also defining a Service Account which we can then tie back to the Vault Policy we created earlier. This allows you to specify each secret an application is allowed to access.

# app.yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    app: vault-agent-demo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: vault-agent-demo
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
      labels:
        app: vault-agent-demo
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: app
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: jweissig/app:0.0.1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    app: vault-agent-demo
```

Next, lets launch our example application and create the service account. We can also verify there are no secrets mounted at /vault/secrets.
```
kubectl create -f app.yaml
kubectl exec -ti app-XXXXXXXXX -c app -- ls -l /vault/secrets

```

Here is a annotations patch we can apply to our running example application’s pod configuration that sets specific annotations for injecting our secret/helloworld Vault secret.

# patch-basic-annotations.yaml
```
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-helloworld: "secret/helloworld"
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "myapp"
```

Next, let’s apply our annotations patch.
```
kubectl patch deployment app --patch "$(cat patch-basic-annotations.yaml)"
kubectl exec -ti app-XXXXXXXXX -c app -- cat /vault/secrets/helloworld

```

If all goes correctly you should now see a tmpfs mount at /vault/secrets and a helloworld secret containered in there. 

What happened here, is that when we applied the patch, our vault-k8s webhook intercepted and changed the pod definition, to include an Init container to pre-populate our secret, and a Vault Agent Sidecar to keep that secret data in sync throughout our applications lifecycle.


However, if you were to actually run this, you would notice that the data in /vault/secrets/helloworld is not formatted, and is just a Go struct export of our secret. This can be problematic, since you almost certainly want the output to be formatted in a particular way, for consumption by your application. So, what is the solution?

```
data: map[password:foobarbazpass username:foobaruser]
metadata: map[created_time:2019-12-16T01:01:58.869828167Z deletion_time: destroyed:false version:1]

```


Well, you can format your secret data using by leveraging Vault Agent Templates, which is very useful for dealing with your various output formatting needs. In the next example here, we are going to parse our secrets data into a postgresql connection string. Templates can come in extremely handy and should fit a variety of your use cases, where you need to conform to existing configuration formats, construct connection stings (as seen below), etc.

# patch-template-annotations.yaml
```
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-status: "update"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-helloworld: "secret/helloworld"
        vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-helloworld: |
          {{- with secret "secret/helloworld" -}}
          postgresql://{{ .Data.data.username }}:{{ .Data.data.password }}@postgres:5432/wizard
          {{- end }}
        vault.hashicorp.com/role: "myapp"
```
Next, just like before, we apply the annotations patch.
```
kubectl patch deployment app --patch "$(cat patch-template-annotations.yaml)"
kubectl exec -ti app-XXXXXXXXX -c app -- cat /vault/secrets/helloworld
```
With the output looking like this:
```
postgresql://foobaruser:foobarbazpass@postgres:5432/wizard
```

The above examples covered a pretty straightforward workflow pattern for injecting a secret into a running application that has no native Vault logic built-in. The applications only need to concern themselves with finding a secret at a filesystem path, that’s it.
