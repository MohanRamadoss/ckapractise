# What is package management?
- Every OS has a Package manager, for example `yum` for RedHat, `HomeBrew` etc.
- The way package manager works at a high level is we have a repository and there a Package manager that provides services to the underlying system.
- The services includes, automated installation, version control, dependency management and automated removal etc.

# Package Management in Kubernetes

- Below is an example of a deployed package in Kubernetes
![](helm_1.jpg)

- Check if there is any Helm chart installed by executing `helm ls` or `helm list`.
- Let's consider a Wordpress deployment.
- Search for the Wordpress by executing `helm search wordpress`.
- Install the Wordpress package using `helm install stable/wordpress`.
- Make sure Wordpress is deployed using `helm ls`.
- Remove the installation using `helm delete <Name of the Helm installation>`
- Install a specific version of Wordpress using `helm install stable/wordpress --version 5.0.1`.
- Updgrade a particular release using `helm upgrade <release name> stable/wordpress`
- Download the Chart into local using `helm fetch stable/wordpress --untar` and `cat requirements.txt`
- As you can see, MariaDB is listed as one of the requirements and has a URL to find the dependency.
- This dependency is installed in Charts directory.
- Let's remove the contents from the Charts directory in order to remove the depencies and now run `helm dep list`. This will show that the dependency is missing.
- In order to resolve the dependencies, run `helm dep update`.
- Local Helm charts can be installed using `helm install .`.
